Privacy Policy for BarTrail

Effective Date: 27th October 2025

BarTrail (“we”, “us”, “our”) respects your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and protect information when you use BarTrail (the “App”). By using the App, you agree to the collection and usage as described.

1. Information We Collect
	•	Location Data (Required for Core Functionality):
 We collect precise background location data during an active session to record your route and detect stops.
	•	Sensor / Motion Data:
 We may collect motion and activity information (steps, walking, stationary) to improve dwell detection.
	•	Reverse Geocoding / Venue Names:
 We convert location coordinates into place names.
	•	Usage Data / Diagnostics:
 We may collect anonymous usage metrics and crash logs to improve performance.

We do not collect personally identifiable information (such as name, email, address) as part of the core features. All sensitive data is stored locally by default.

2. Use of Information

We use collected data to:
	•	Generate your route map and detect stops (dwell points).

	•	Provide heatmaps and advanced analytics (Premium features).
	•	Diagnose and fix app errors or performance issues (anonymous diagnostics).

⸻

3. Disclosure of Information

We do not sell, rent, or share your personal location data with third parties. The only circumstances we may disclose data:
	•	If required to comply with law or a valid legal process.
	•	If you explicitly opt into a feature that requires data sharing (e.g. feedback).
	•	To our service providers but only when necessary and under data protection obligations.

⸻

4. Data Retention & Storage
	•	All your location histories, sessions, and summaries stay on your device unless you choose to export or share them.
	•	For Premium users with cloud sync (if implemented in the future), your data may be encrypted and stored in cloud infrastructure you control.
	•	You may delete any session or all data at any time from within the App.

⸻

5. User Rights & Controls
	•	You may withdraw permission for location or motion access in device settings.
	•	You may delete your usage data at any time from the App settings.
	•	If we introduce account linking or cloud storage in later versions, you’ll be provided control over your data (export, erase, etc.).

⸻

6. Security

We take reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect your data on the device. However, no system is entirely secure, so we cannot guarantee absolute security.

⸻

7. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy when App features or legal requirements change. We will post the new version with a revised “Effective Date” and highlight material changes to you.
